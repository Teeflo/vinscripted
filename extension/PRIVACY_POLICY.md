# Privacy Policy for Vinscripted

**Last Updated: February 4, 2026**

Vinscripted ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in relation to our Chrome extension.

## 1. Information Collection and Use
Vinscripted does **not** collect, store, or share any personal information. 
- **Images**: When you use the extension to generate a description, screenshots of the item photos you have uploaded to Vinted are sent to our backend for analysis. These images are processed in memory only and are **not stored** on our servers or shared with any third parties other than the AI processing service (Google Gemini API).
- **Authentication**: We do not require an account or any personal login information.

## 2. Permissions
The extension requires the following permissions to function:
- `storage`: To save your preferred language and backend URL settings locally on your device.
- `activeTab` & `host_permissions`: To detect when you are on a Vinted listing page and to inject the AI assistance button.
- `scripting`: To read the images from the page and insert the generated description.

## 3. Third-Party Services
We use the **Google Gemini API** to analyze images and generate descriptions. Your data is subject to Google's Privacy Policy and AI terms of service only during the transient processing phase.

## 4. Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here.

## 5. Contact
If you have any questions, please contact us via our GitHub repository.
